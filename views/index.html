			<p>The front-end starts with back-end (of sorts) in Java. This application uses Jsoup to parse DOM elements from HTML which I have downloaded. It breaks the content of the statute into objects ranging from the smallest units (I call them 'Unit' but they appear as 'paragraphs' through 'sub-sub-sub-sub-paragraphs' in the law), to Sections, to Chapters. Paragraphs have numbers and text.</p>

			<p> Sections contain paragraphs, but may also contain an Introduction, Reversion, Catchline, History, and multiple Notes. Sections also mantain a list of years it exists, since they are added and removed occasionally.</p>
			<p>Each section object is output to an HTML file with front-matter for use by Jekyll. The Java application also uses regex to identify History citations to the Florida Laws, and embed links to those amendments.</p>

			<p>The code for the font-end is on GitHub at ( <a href="https://github.com/dmck/views/">https://github.com/dmck/views/</a> ) and centers around Bootstrap v. 4 Alpha, Javascript, and Jekyll.</p>
			<p>Javascript features include the addition of a search box, which is prefilled with user-highlighted text. This text is also set to query Google Scholar to search caselaw or the statute (by way of a public search engine).</p>
			<p>While the Florida Legislature's website requires users to return to the main page to change years, this site provides a drawer containing the available years for easy navigation.</p>
