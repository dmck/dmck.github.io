A snapshot of the original site is viewable using [WaybackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20120213173617/http://williamhmcknight.com/). This  project switched the Wordpress site to the [Gather](https://themetrust.com/themes/gather/) theme, and added customizations.

Adding an off-canvas menu helps potential clients who are browsing on mobile phones. The additional map helps users locate the office and obtain directions. Improvements to the appearance include Creative Commons images, a subtle background, and typographical changes.
